args:
  b: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x. The bias vector.
  cell_clip: An optional float. Defaults to 3.Value to clip the 'cs' value to.
  cs_prev: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x.Value of the initial cell state.
  forget_bias: An optional float. Defaults to 1. The forget gate bias.
  h_prev: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x.Initial output of cell (to be used
    for peephole).
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  seq_len_max: A Tensor of type int64.Maximum time length actually used by this input.
    Outputs are paddedwith zeros beyond this length.
  use_peephole: An optional bool. Defaults to False.Whether to use peephole weights.
  w: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x. The weight matrix.
  wcf: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x.The weight matrix for forget gate peephole
    connection.
  wci: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x.The weight matrix for input gate peephole
    connection.
  wco: A Tensor. Must have the same type as x.The weight matrix for output gate peephole
    connection.
  x: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32.The sequence input
    to the LSTM, shape (timelen, batch_size, num_inputs).'
error_message: tds len error.[Returns need 1 tds]

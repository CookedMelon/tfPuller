args:
  boxes: a tensor of rank 2 or higher with a shape of [..., num_boxes, 4].Dimensions
    except the last two are batch dimensions.
  canonicalized_coordinates: if box coordinates are given as[y_min, x_min, y_max,
    x_max], setting to True eliminate redundant computation to canonicalize box coordinates.
  iou_threshold: a float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxesoverlap
    too much with respect to IoU (intersection over union).
  max_output_size: a scalar integer Tensor representing the maximum numberof boxes
    to be selected by non max suppression. Note that setting thisvalue to a large
    number may result in OOM error depending on the systemworkload.
  name: name of operation.
  pad_to_max_output_size: whether to pad the output idx to max_output_size.Must be
    set to True when the input is a batch of images.
  score_threshold: a float representing the threshold for box scores. Boxeswith a
    score that is not larger than this threshold will be suppressed.
  scores: a tensor of rank 1 or higher with a shape of [..., num_boxes].
  sorted_input: a boolean indicating whether the input boxes and scoresare sorted
    in descending order by the score.
  tile_size: an integer representing the number of boxes in a tile, i.e.,the maximum
    number of boxes per image that can be used to suppress otherboxes in parallel;
    larger tile_size means larger parallelism andpotentially more redundant work.
error_message: tds len error.[Returns need 1 tds]

returns: 'idx: a tensor with a shape of [..., num_boxes] representing the  indices
  selected by non-max suppression. The leading dimensions  are the batch dimensions
  of the input boxes. All numbers are within  [0, num_boxes). For each image (i.e.,
  idx[i]), only the first num_valid[i]  indices (i.e., idx[i][:num_valid[i]]) are
  valid.num_valid: a tensor of rank 0 or higher with a shape of [...]  representing
  the number of valid indices in idx. Its dimensions are the  batch dimensions of
  the input boxes.'

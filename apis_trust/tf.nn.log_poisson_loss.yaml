args:
  compute_full_loss: whether to compute the full loss. If false, a constantterm is
    dropped in favor of more efficient optimization.
  log_input: A Tensor of type float32 or float64.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  targets: A Tensor of the same type and shape as log_input.
name: tf.nn.log_poisson_loss
returns: A Tensor of the same shape as log_input with the componentwiselogistic losses.

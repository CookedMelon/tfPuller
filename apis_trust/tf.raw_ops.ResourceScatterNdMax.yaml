args:
  indices: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64.A Tensor. Must
    be one of the following types: int32, int64.A tensor of indices into ref.'
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  ref: A Tensor of type resource.A resource handle. Must be from a VarHandleOp.
  updates: A Tensor. A Tensor. Must have the same type as ref. A tensor ofvalues whose
    element wise max is taken with ref
  use_locking: An optional bool. Defaults to True.An optional bool. Defaults to True.
    If True, the assignment willbe protected by a lock; otherwise the behavior is
    undefined,but may exhibit less contention.

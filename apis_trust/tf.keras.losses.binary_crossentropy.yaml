args:
  axis: The axis along which the mean is computed. Defaults to -1.
  from_logits: Whether y_pred is expected to be a logits tensor. Bydefault, we assume
    that y_pred encodes a probability distribution.
  label_smoothing: Float in [0, 1]. If > 0 then smooth the labels bysqueezing them
    towards 0.5 That is, using1. - 0.5 * label_smoothing for the target class and0.5
    * label_smoothing for the non-target class.
  y_pred: The predicted values. shape = [batch_size, d0, .. dN].
  y_true: Ground truth values. shape = [batch_size, d0, .. dN].
name: tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy
returns: Binary crossentropy loss value. shape = [batch_size, d0, .. dN-1].

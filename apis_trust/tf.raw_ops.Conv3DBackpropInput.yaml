args:
  dilations: An optional list of ints. Defaults to [1, 1, 1, 1, 1].
  filter: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input.Shape [depth, rows, cols, in_channels,
    out_channels].in_channels must match between input and filter.
  input: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.Shape
    [batch, depth, rows, cols, in_channels].'
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  out_backprop: A Tensor. Must have the same type as input.Backprop signal of shape
    [batch, out_depth, out_rows, out_cols,out_channels].
  padding: 'A string from: "SAME", "VALID".The type of padding algorithm to use.'
  strides: A list of ints that has length >= 5.1-D tensor of length 5. The stride
    of the sliding window for eachdimension of input. Must have strides[0] = strides[4]
    = 1.
name: tf.raw_ops.Conv3DBackpropInput
returns: A Tensor. Has the same type as input.

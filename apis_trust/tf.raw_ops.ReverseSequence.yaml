args:
  batch_dim: An optional int. Defaults to 0.The dimension along which reversal is
    performed.
  input: A Tensor. The input to reverse.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  seq_dim: An int. The dimension which is partially reversed.
  seq_lengths: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64.1-D with
    length input.dims(batch_dim) andmax(seq_lengths) <= input.dims(seq_dim)'
name: tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence
returns: A Tensor. Has the same type as input.

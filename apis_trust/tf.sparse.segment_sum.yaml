args:
  data: A Tensor with data that will be assembled in the output.
  indices: A 1-D Tensor with indices into data. Has same rank assegment_ids.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  num_segments: An optional int32 scalar. Indicates the size of the outputTensor.
  segment_ids: A 1-D Tensor with indices into the output Tensor. Valuesshould be sorted
    and can be repeated.
name: tf.sparse.segment_sum
returns: A tensor of the shape as data, except for dimension 0 whichhas size k, the
  number of segments specified via num_segments orinferred for the last element in
  segments_ids.

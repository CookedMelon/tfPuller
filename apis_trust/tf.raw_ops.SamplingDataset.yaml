args:
  input_dataset: A Tensor of type variant.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes: A list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints) that has
    length >= 1.
  output_types: A list of tf.DTypes that has length >= 1.
  rate: A Tensor of type float32.A scalar representing the sample rate. Each element
    of input_dataset isretained with this probability, independent of all other elements.
  seed: A Tensor of type int64.A scalar representing seed of random number generator.
  seed2: A Tensor of type int64.A scalar representing seed2 of random number generator.
name: tf.raw_ops.SamplingDataset
returns: A Tensor of type variant.

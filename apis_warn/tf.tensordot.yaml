args:
  a: Tensor of type float32 or float64.
  axes: Either a scalar N, or a list or an int32 Tensor of shape [2, k].If axes is
    a scalar, sum over the last N axes of a and the first N axes ofb in order. If
    axes is a list or Tensor the first and second row containthe set of unique integers
    specifying axes along which the contraction iscomputed, for a and b, respectively.
    The number of axes for a andb must be equal. If axes=0, computes the outer product
    between a andb.
  b: Tensor with the same type as a.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
name: tf.tensordot
returns: A Tensor with the same type as a.

args:
  axis: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64.The dimensions
    to reduce. Must be in the range[-rank(input), rank(input)).'
  input: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: float32, float64, int32, uint8,
    int16, int8, complex64, int64, qint8, quint8, qint32, bfloat16, qint16, quint16,
    uint16, complex128, half, uint32, uint64.The tensor to reduce.'
  keep_dims: An optional bool. Defaults to False.If true, retain reduced dimensions
    with length 1.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
name: tf.raw_ops.EuclideanNorm
returns: A Tensor. Has the same type as input.

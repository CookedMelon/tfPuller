args:
  data_format: A string,one of channels_last (default) or channels_first.The ordering
    of the dimensions in the inputs.channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape(batch,
    height, width, channels) while channels_firstcorresponds to inputs with shape(batch,
    channels, height, width).When unspecified, usesimage_data_format value found in
    your Keras config file at ~/.keras/keras.json (if exists) else 'channels_last'.Defaults
    to 'channels_last'.
  keepdims: A boolean, whether to keep the spatial dimensions or not.If keepdims is
    False (default), the rank of the tensor is reducedfor spatial dimensions.If keepdims
    is True, the spatial dimensions are retained withlength 1.The behavior is the
    same as for tf.reduce_max or np.max.

args:
  data_format: A string. 'NWC' and 'NCW' are supported.
  dilations: An int or list of ints that has length 1 or 3 whichdefaults to 1. The
    dilation factor for each dimension of input. If set tok > 1, there will be k-1
    skipped cells between each filter element on thatdimension. Dilations in the batch
    and depth dimensions must be 1.
  filters: A 3-D Tensor with the same type as input and shape[filter_width, output_channels,
    in_channels].  filter'sin_channels dimension must match that of input.
  input: A 3-D Tensor of type float and shape[batch, in_width, in_channels] for NWC
    data format or[batch, in_channels, in_width] for NCW data format.
  name: Optional name for the returned tensor.
  output_shape: A 1-D Tensor, containing three elements, representing theoutput shape
    of the deconvolution op.
  padding: A string, either 'VALID' or 'SAME'. The padding algorithm. Seeherefor more
    information.
  strides: An int or list of ints that has length 1 or 3.  The number ofentries by
    which the filter is moved right at each step.
name: tf.nn.conv1d_transpose
returns: A Tensor with the same type as input.

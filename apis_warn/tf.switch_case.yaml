args:
  branch_fns: A dict mapping ints to callables, or a list of (int,callable) pairs,
    or simply a list of callables (in which case the indexserves as the key). Each
    callable must return a matching structure oftensors.
  branch_index: An int Tensor specifying which of branch_fns should beexecuted.
  default: Optional callable that returns a structure of tensors.
  name: A name for this operation (optional).
name: tf.switch_case
returns: The tensors returned by the callable identified by branch_index, or thosereturned
  by default if no key matches and default was provided, or thosereturned by the max-keyed
  branch_fn if no default is provided.

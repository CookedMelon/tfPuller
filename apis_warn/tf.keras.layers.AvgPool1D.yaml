args:
  data_format: A string,one of channels_last (default) or channels_first.The ordering
    of the dimensions in the inputs.channels_last corresponds to inputs with shape(batch,
    steps, features) while channels_firstcorresponds to inputs with shape(batch, features,
    steps).
  padding: One of "valid" or "same" (case-insensitive)."valid" means no padding. "same"
    results in padding evenly tothe left/right or up/down of the input such that output
    has the sameheight/width dimension as the input.
  pool_size: Integer, size of the average pooling windows.
  strides: Integer, or None. Factor by which to downscale.E.g. 2 will halve the input.If
    None, it will default to pool_size.

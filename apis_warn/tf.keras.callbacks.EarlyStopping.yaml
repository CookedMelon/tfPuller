args:
  baseline: Baseline value for the monitored quantity.Training will stop if the model
    doesn't show improvement over thebaseline.
  min_delta: Minimum change in the monitored quantityto qualify as an improvement,
    i.e. an absolutechange of less than min_delta, will count as noimprovement.
  mode: One of {"auto", "min", "max"}. In min mode,training will stop when the quantitymonitored
    has stopped decreasing; in "max"mode it will stop when the quantitymonitored has
    stopped increasing; in "auto"mode, the direction is automatically inferredfrom
    the name of the monitored quantity.
  monitor: Quantity to be monitored.
  patience: Number of epochs with no improvementafter which training will be stopped.
  restore_best_weights: Whether to restore model weights fromthe epoch with the best
    value of the monitored quantity.If False, the model weights obtained at the last
    step oftraining are used. An epoch will be restored regardlessof the performance
    relative to the baseline. If no epochimproves on baseline, training will run for
    patienceepochs and restore weights from the best epoch in that set.
  start_from_epoch: Number of epochs to wait before startingto monitor improvement.
    This allows for a warm-up period in whichno improvement is expected and thus training
    will not be stopped.
  verbose: Verbosity mode, 0 or 1. Mode 0 is silent, and mode 1displays messages when
    the callback takes an action.

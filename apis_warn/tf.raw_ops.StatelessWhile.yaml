args:
  body: A function decorated with @Defun.A function that takes a list of tensors and
    returns anotherlist of tensors. Both lists have the same types as specifiedby
    T.
  cond: 'A function decorated with @Defun.A function takes ''input'' and returns a
    tensor.  If the tensor isa scalar of non-boolean, the scalar is converted to a
    booleanaccording to the following rule: if the scalar is a numericalvalue, non-zero
    means True and zero means False; if the scalar isa string, non-empty means True
    and empty means False. If thetensor is not a scalar, non-emptiness means True
    and Falseotherwise.This should only be used when the while condition and body
    functionsdo not have stateful ops.'
  input: A list of Tensor objects.A list of input tensors whose types are T.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
  output_shapes: An optional list of shapes (each a tf.TensorShape or list of ints).
    Defaults to [].
  parallel_iterations: An optional int. Defaults to 10.
name: tf.raw_ops.StatelessWhile
returns: A list of Tensor objects. Has the same type as input.

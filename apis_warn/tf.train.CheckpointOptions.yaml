args:
  enable_async: bool Type. Indicates whether async checkpointing is enabled.Default
    is False, i.e., no async checkpoint.Async checkpoint moves the checkpoint file
    writing off the main thread,so that the model can continue to train while the
    checkpoing filewriting runs in the background. Async checkpoint reduces TPU device
    idlecycles and speeds up model training process, while memory consumptionmay increase.
  experimental_enable_async_checkpoint: bool Type. Deprecated, please usethe enable_async
    option.
  experimental_io_device: string. Applies in a distributed setting.Tensorflow device
    to use to access the filesystem. If None (default)then for each variable the filesystem
    is accessed from the CPU:0 deviceof the host where that variable is assigned.
    If specified, thefilesystem is instead accessed from that device for all variables.This
    is for example useful if you want to save to a local directory,such as "/tmp"
    when running in a distributed setting. In that case passa device for the host
    where the "/tmp" directory is accessible.

args:
  block_size: An int that is >= 2.
  crops: 'A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: int32, int64.2-D tensor of
    non-negative integers with shape [2, 2]. It specifieshow many elements to crop
    from the intermediate result across the spatialdimensions as follows:crops = [[crop_top,
    crop_bottom], [crop_left, crop_right]]'
  input: A Tensor. 4-D tensor with shape[batch*block_size*block_size, height_pad/block_size,
    width_pad/block_size,  depth]. Note that the batch size of the input tensor must
    be divisible byblock_size * block_size.
  name: A name for the operation (optional).
name: tf.raw_ops.BatchToSpace
returns: A Tensor. Has the same type as input.
